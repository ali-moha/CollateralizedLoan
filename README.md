# CollateralizedLoan Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract which is a very basic code for a collateralized Loan project, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

The contract has been deployed to Sepolia network. Please check the following link [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x259D79f071fC762701D354f3f40CF523FF38C8aB).
